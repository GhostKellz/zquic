### Use Cases Enabled

This release enables zQUIC to power:

- âœ… **GhostMesh VPN** - Tailscale-like mesh networking with QUIC transport
- âœ… **High-performance proxies** - UDP multiplexing with intelligent load balancing  
- âœ… **IoT/Edge networking** - Lightweight async runtime with connection pooling
- âœ… **Blockchain transport** - Secure, multiplexed connections for crypto nodes
- âœ… **Real-time applications** - Low-latency packet processing with async I/O

### Breaking Changes

- **Socket API Changes** - UDP socket methods now return proper error types instead of stubs
- **Crypto API Updates** - Enhanced crypto functions require proper key material (no more placeholders)
- **Connection Management** - Connections now require async runtime integration for full functionality

### Dependencies

- **Zig 0.15.0-dev** or later
- **TokiZ async runtime** (production-ready Phase 2 version)
- **Platform support**: Linux (primary), BSD variants, macOS

### Migration Guide

For existing zQUIC users upgrading from v0.1.0:

1. **Update imports** - Add new modules (`UdpMultiplexer`, `AsyncRuntime`, `VpnRouter`, `LoadBalancer`)
2. **Replace UDP sockets** - Update code using UDP socket stubs to handle real socket errors
3. **Integrate async runtime** - Connections now benefit from async task management
4. **Update crypto usage** - Enhanced crypto requires proper initialization (see examples)
